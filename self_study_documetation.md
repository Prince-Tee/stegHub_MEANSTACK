# Self-Study Documentation: MEAN Stack Project Deployment on AWS

## Overview

This documentation captures my learning journey while deploying a MEAN stack application on an AWS EC2 instance. The project involved setting up a MongoDB database, creating an Express server, and developing a user interface with Angular.

## Objectives

- Deploy a fully functional MEAN stack application on AWS.
- Ensure seamless communication between the application and MongoDB.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for managing To-Do items.
- Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.

## Steps and Challenges Encountered

### 1. Launching an EC2 Instance

I started by creating a free-tier EC2 instance on AWS and generated a key pair for SSH access.

### 2. Connecting to the EC2 Instance

After launching the instance, I connected via SSH.

**Challenges:**
- Encountered a "permission denied" error when attempting to SSH into the instance.

**Solution:**
- I used the command `chmod 400 your-key.pem` to adjust the permissions on my SSH key, which resolved the connection issue.

### 3. Setting Up the Environment

I updated the instance, installed Node.js, and set up MongoDB.

**Challenges:**
- Faced installation issues with MongoDB due to unmet dependencies and configuration problems.

**Solution:**
- I followed the MongoDB installation guide and ensured all prerequisite packages were installed correctly. Additionally, I checked for compatibility issues with the Node.js version.

### 4. Developing the Application

I organized the project structure, creating necessary folders for routes, models, and the main application file (`server.js`).

**Challenges:**
- Understanding how to effectively set up routes and models using Express and Mongoose was initially challenging.

**Solution:**
- I referred to online tutorials and documentation to deepen my understanding of RESTful API principles and Mongoose ORM. This research allowed me to implement the structure effectively.

### 5. Testing Functionality

After building the application, I used Postman to test the API endpoints for adding, deleting, and retrieving To-Do items.

**Challenges:**
- I encountered issues with API requests, particularly regarding incorrect request formatting and missing fields.

**Solution:**
- By using Postmanâ€™s debugging features, I was able to identify the errors in my API requests, which led to successful interaction with the backend.

### 6. Final Deployment

I configured the application to ensure it was accessible via a public IP address.

**Challenges:**
- Configuring AWS security groups to allow HTTP and TCP traffic posed some difficulties.

**Solution:**
- I thoroughly reviewed the security group settings in the AWS console, modifying inbound rules to allow traffic on necessary ports (HTTP and custom TCP) to make my application accessible.

## Conclusion

This self-study project has significantly enhanced my understanding of the MEAN stack and AWS deployment practices. I gained hands-on experience in server setup, database management, and full-stack development.

## Reflections

The project taught me the importance of effective troubleshooting and the value of leveraging online resources. I also learned that clear documentation is essential for navigating complex cloud environments.

## Future Directions

- Explore additional AWS services to improve application performance and scalability.
- Investigate containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Continue enhancing my skills in frontend frameworks and RESTful API design.
